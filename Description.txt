Take Runequest: put into game engine.

runequest: LAST ONE!!! This is completely open, and widely liked.

80 characteristic design points
1 point in a characteristic = 1 design point
cannot have lower than 6 or greater than 18

Should I start my army at all 12 (average)?

Strength (reduce to 0, become bed-ridden)
Con (reduce to 0, hero dies)
Size (hit points, with strength)
Int (extremely important!)
Power (reduce to 0, hero dies)
Charisma: influences number of improvement rolls the adventurer has when opportunities for skill and characteristic improvements com around.

Actions (INT + DEX) / 2) / 6 and ROUND DOWN
if (INT + DEX) /2 = 6 or less: 1 action
7-12: 2 actions
13-18: 3 actions
+1 action for each additional 6 points

Damage Modifier:
STR + SIZ
1-5: -1D8
6-10: -1D6
11-15: -1D4
16-20: -1D2
21-25: +0
26-30: +1D2
31-35: +1D4
36-40: +1D6
41-45: +1D8
46-50: +1D10
51-60: +1D12
61-70: +2D6
71-80: +2D8
81-90: +2D10
91-100: +2D12


Hit points = Con + Size
There is a location table here:
Legs
Abdomen
Chest
Each Arm
HEad

could also just use total HP count.

CHA improvement roll modifier:
6 or less: -1
7-12: 0
13-18: +1
for each 6 above: +1 again

Magic Points == Pow

Movement = 8

Strike Rank = (INT + DEX) / 2 Round UP
strikeRank -= armor encumberance (Total Armour points / 5)

skills have base ranks based on attributes. Will need to generate that.

Common skills: Everyone has this

We choose cultural background: peasant

profession = farmer
background: get bonuses, but have to create my own template.

we get 250 skill points.

Forego those. HAHAHAHA!
But give those to opponents :D.
Also, we don't access common magic, but it exists.


skills: after modifiers, roll under percent.
A roll that is equal to or less than 10% of the modified value is a critical success
a roll of 01 is ALWAYS a critical success.

fumbles occur on a 99 or 100...ouch!

01 to 05 is automatic success
96 to 00 is automatic failure

opposed skills: skill is actively resisted by another.
Winner is the one who gains the higher LEVEL of success

(i.e. succeede by 10 points vs. succeede by 5 pts. IT's not on the die roll but by how much you succeeded)

if a character has over 100% in a skill, however much he is over by, he subtracts that value from the other players' skills.

One improvement roll will increase 1 known skill...
roll 1D100. Add your Int to that. If you roll GREATER than the skills score, raise it by 1D4 + 1 points.
Otherwise raise it by 1.

Improve characteristics:
To improve a characteristic, Improvement rolls equal to that characteristic's current value must be used.

Combat is deadly
Combat is tactical.
Combat: trained in styles. Spear and Shield, Sword and Shield, GreateSpear, Greatsword, GreatAxe

Engine for substituting weapons:

-10% skill for different weapon
-10% for each size category difference
-10% for each reach category difference
-5% for each point of encumberence

Ouch...you just don't want to do this.

Strike rank
1d10 + Strike Rank -( (totalled armour points on all locations) / 5)

Movement:

may move upt to standard movement allowance.
EACH combat action may take some or all of the character's allotted movement

Also, defensive actions are combat actions: parrying, etc...

Options:
attack
Cast Spell
Change distance (closing or disengaging...further rules)
Change stance (get up from prone, etc)
Delay: changes strike rank while character waits to attack. If strike rank hits 0, nothing happens
Do Nothing: stupid idea
Evade: parry, dodge, etc..
Move: if unengaged, adventurer may move
Outmanoeuver: Adventurer may engage multiple opponents ina  group opposed test of evade skill. Those who fail to beat him/her cannot attack that combat round.
Ready Weapon

WEapons:
Size, Reach, weight, damage, etc..

Defensive combat manoeuvre:
PArrying
Successful roll:
if the weapon is of equal or greater size: defender gets 0 damage
One size difference: half damage
Greater size difference than this: no damage deflected.

If attack fails, then you can still try to parry and gain a  defensive combat manoeuvre.

if one fails and the other succeedes: the successor gets one combat manoeuver.
If both fail, nothing
if one fumbles and other fails, failure gets one combat manoeuver
if both fumble, nothing
if one fumbles and one succeedes, two combat manoeuvres for successor.
If one crits and other fumbles, 3 combat manoeuvres
one crit and other fail, 2 combat manoeuvres.
one crit and one success, 1 combat manoeuvre.

Combat manoeuvres are strange...There may be a better way to do this. Re-read rules...

This maybe the last part of combat incorporated into the engine.

Also, close combat situational modifiers:
helpless, surprised, prone, unstable ground, confined situation, defending on lower ground or against mounted foe (mportant!), fighting in partial darkness, fighting in darkness, fighting wile blind or in pitch black.

Cover: important
check out choose location rules

knockback: any damage greater than size of one receiving damage, causes knockback.

Evade: one defender against multiple opponents. If evade successful, still cannot reduce opponents to less than one.

review rules for weapon reach. They are kind of cool.

wind affects missile weapons.
Light wind: -5%
Moderate wind: -10%
Strong Wind: -50% (this would kill us!)

Target has moved:
10M or more: -10%
30m or more: -20%

This hampers ranged attack too... interesting.

Target is helpless: +10%
Target is obscured partial darkness, mist, etc..: 20%
target is more obscured: thick smoke, etc..: 40%
Target is prone: -10%

rules for firing into crowd: helpful at beginning.

Magic points: regained after 6 hours of sleep, or 12 waking hours. Minus a pact.

Pact (CHA + Dedicated POW)
Pow dedicated = minimum 1 point and maximum 1/4 of POW
IF critical success: spell is cast, and may be recast
if success: spell is cast and must be re-given
If failure: spell is not cast, but is still available.
Fumble: spell is unavailable, and must be re-gotten

Magnitude of divine spells: power percentage, divided by 10. Rounded up.
Skill of divine power: lore skill.

To regain spell:
Initiate: a day after cast, at holy place
Acolyte: a day after cast, wherever. But if failed to regain, must go to holy place
PRiest: may regain spell wherever, an hour after it was cast. BUT if failure, must go to holy place
High priest: if failure may still regain spell wherever. Must only return to shrine if critical failure


High priest: everything goes to divine power.

A lot of these rules can be changed...
