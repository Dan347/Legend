Workflow:

create character.

Character is poco object.


We create advanced skills that the character has.
We assign the advanced skills to a holder object.
We assign basic skills to a holder object.
We create attributes. Assign this to an attributes object.
We then create the character: name, advanced skills, basic skills, and attributes.

For the character...we almost don't need attributes. Can use the builder to create the pieces of the character, and the character will hold the
base objects.

Currently: finish CharacterBuilder. Need to build skills.
AdvancedSkills: ONLY SPECIFIC SKILLS ARE BUILT!
BasicSkills: All skills are built.
//need a skillBuilder or skill factory: takes from skill repository and builds it, using character.

Then begin writing combat rules engine :).
