# PlayCanvas WebGL Game Engine

PlayCanvas is an open-source game engine. It uses HTML5 and WebGL to run games and other interactive 3D content in all modern browsers without the need for a plugin.

## Published games

Many games have been published using the PlayCanvas engine. Here is a small selection.

## Usage

Here's a super-simple Hello World example - a spinning cube!

```html
<script>
    // Create a PlayCanvas application
    var canvas = document.getElementById("application-canvas");
    var app = new pc.fw.Application(canvas, {});
    app.start();

    // Fill the available space at full resolution
    app.setCanvasFillMode(pc.fw.FillMode.FILL_WINDOW);
    app.setCanvasResolution(pc.fw.ResolutionMode.AUTO);

    // Create box entity
    var cube = new pc.fw.Entity();
    app.context.systems.model.addComponent(cube, {
        type: "box"
    });

    // Create camera entity
    var camera = new pc.fw.Entity();
    app.context.systems.camera.addComponent(camera, {
        clearColor: new pc.Color(0.1, 0.1, 0.1)
    });

    // Create directional light entity
    var light = new pc.fw.Entity();
    app.context.systems.light.addComponent(light);

    // Add to hierarchy
    app.context.root.addChild(cube);
    app.context.root.addChild(camera);
    app.context.root.addChild(light);

    // Set up initial positions and orientations
    camera.setPosition(0, 0, 3);
    light.setEulerAngles(45, 0, 0);

    // Register an update event
    app.on("update", function (deltaTime) {
    	cube.rotate(10 * deltaTime, 20 * deltaTime, 30 * deltaTime);
    });
</script>
```
